Okay, I've reviewed the code snippet:

```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

Here's what I've found and some suggestions:

**Issues:**

*   **Undeclared Variables (`a` and `b`):**  The function attempts to use variables `a` and `b` without them being defined or passed as arguments. This will lead to an error (likely `ReferenceError: a is not defined` and `ReferenceError: b is not defined`) when the function is executed.  JavaScript doesn't automatically know where `a` and `b` are coming from.

*   **Lack of Arguments:** The function `sum` doesn't accept any arguments.  A `sum` function should generally take the numbers you want to add as input.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Pass Arguments to the Function:** The most direct way to fix this is to define `a` and `b` as parameters of the `sum` function.

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }

    // Example usage:
    let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
    console.log(result);
    ```

2.  **Handle Potential Non-Number Inputs (Robustness):**  You might want to add checks to ensure that the inputs are actually numbers, or handle cases where they might not be.

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers."; // Or throw an error
      }
      return a + b;
    }

    console.log(sum(2, "hello")); // Output: Error: Both arguments must be numbers.
    ```

3.  **Consider a More Flexible `sum` Function (for summing an array of numbers):** If you want to sum an arbitrary number of values, you can use the rest parameter (`...`) to collect all arguments into an array:

    ```javascript
    function sum(...numbers) {
      let total = 0;
      for (let number of numbers) {
        if (typeof number !== 'number') {
          return "Error: All arguments must be numbers.";
        }
        total += number;
      }
      return total;
    }

    console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10
    console.log(sum(1, 2, "a"));    // Output: Error: All arguments must be numbers.
    ```
    Or, even more concisely using `reduce`:

    ```javascript
    function sum(...numbers) {
      if (numbers.some(num => typeof num !== 'number')) {
        return "Error: All arguments must be numbers.";
      }
      return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
    }
    ```

4.  **Arrow Function Syntax (Optional):** If you prefer a more compact syntax (and you're using a modern JavaScript environment), you can use an arrow function:

    ```javascript
    const sum = (a, b) => a + b;  // Simple version

    const sum = (...numbers) => {  // Array version
      if (numbers.some(num => typeof num !== 'number')) {
        return "Error: All arguments must be numbers.";
      }
      return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
    };
    ```

**Summary of Recommendations**

*   **Always define your variables or pass them as arguments to your functions.** This is crucial for correct code execution.
*   Consider the intended use case of your `sum` function.  Do you want to sum exactly two numbers, or a variable number of numbers?
*   Think about error handling.  What should happen if the inputs are not what you expect?

Choose the solution that best fits your needs. The first example (passing `a` and `b` as arguments) is likely the simplest and most appropriate if you always intend to sum exactly two numbers.
